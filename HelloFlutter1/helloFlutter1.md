## Hello Flutter

I've always had an interest in UI frameworks, so I wanted to give Flutter a quick look see. I plan on making a few posts following along with the process of getting it up and started as well as some early development work.

### Installing

[Windows Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)

To start with, the installation consisting of just unzipping to a directory and adding to that path was much appreciated. Years of working with Visual Studio have given me too much fear every time I install a dev tool on my machine. Will I be able to remove it? What is it actually installing? Love knowing that I can just delete a folder and clear it from my path to get back to zero Flutter on my box. The `flutter doctor` application was also very helpful to provide a quick command line look at exactly what I had installed on my system and if I was ready to run.
